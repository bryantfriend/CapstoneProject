<!-- Substantive description of page: At the top of this page is my basic menu. This page is my main page, or index page. It is the first page
a user will see when they come to my site. It starts off with a picture of a swimming pool and then talks a little about swimming. I decided then to create a 
table with basic stroke terms so the user could understand them when they come up in the rest of the site.-->
